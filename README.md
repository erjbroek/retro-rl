## Retro-rl
retro-rl is a repository where i play around with different reinforcement learning algoritms on retro games like Super Mario Bros for the NES.

future steps to implement smb-nes:

- [x] Set up environment  
- [x] apply preprocessing
- [x] setup of initial model
- [ ] model finetuning (like frameskipping or sticky actions
